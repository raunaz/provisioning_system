# 👋 Hi, I'm RaunaZ (raunaz)

> Crafting reliable JavaScript tools and automation — building things that just work.

I'm a passionate developer focused on shipping clean, maintainable JavaScript code and solving infrastructure and developer-experience problems with pragmatic automation. I build tools, libraries, and systems that help teams move faster and reduce friction.

## 🚀 Quick snapshot
- 🔭 Currently maintaining: [provisioning_system](https://github.com/raunaz/provisioning_system) (JavaScript)
- 🌱 Always learning: modern JS tooling, testing strategies, and scalable automation
- 💡 Interests: developer experience, automation, CLI tooling, observability
- ⚡ Fun fact: I prefer elegant, well-documented code over clever hacks

---

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
- Languages: JavaScript, (add others you use)
- Frameworks & Tools: Node.js, npm/yarn, CLI development, testing (Jest/Mocha)
- DevOps & Infra: automation, provisioning scripts, CI/CD
- Practices: TDD, modular design, clear documentation, maintainable APIs

(If you'd like, I can convert this into a badges row or a compact skill table.)
